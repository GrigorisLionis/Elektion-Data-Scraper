# Election-Data-Scraper
Simple scraper for greek parliamentary election data from the official web site (https://ekloges.ypes.gr/)  
As  gioiliop7   suggested there is an API for scraping some of the data.  
Implemeted a python script for downloading the election data, and saving them to a JSON file as a dictionary  
A second script -exportcsv.py- reads the JSON files and exports data to csv
